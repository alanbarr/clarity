* cc3000 recv() doesn't seem to do any internal checking on buffer size. Care needs
  to be taken whenever calling this function, and presumably send().

* get rid of clarity.c

* mgmt - at init permit ptr to callback function for watchdog? If not NULL create a new thread which will
  attempt tp grab mutex every 100 ms or so? If we cant get it say over a period of 60 seconds assume borked?
  It would help to define all timeouts in the same place (e.g. a timeout in ms for server accepts). May still
  run into issues with users holding the mutex soooo have a mutex lock call counter? if it increments
  then we know we are simply coming in at a bad time.
